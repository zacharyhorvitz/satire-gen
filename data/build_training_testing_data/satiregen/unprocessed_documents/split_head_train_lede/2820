Aiming to provide customers with an effective and easy way to consume their products free from judgment, Taco Bell officials announced Thursday that patrons at any of the fast food chain’s 5,600 locations will now be given the option to have their purchases appear inconspicuously on credit card and bank statements under the name “TBfoodsLLC.” “At Taco Bell, we understand that you might want to keep your meal purchases hidden from your spouse, friends, or anyone who might catch sight of your financial documents, and our objective is to protect our customers’ privacy by ensuring that the name Taco Bell appears nowhere on any bank website or official paperwork,” said company spokesman Adam Webb, touting the new measure as a convenient alternative for its customers who have long had to pay for their Taco Bell items in cash to avoid the embarrassing possibility of being found out by a financial paper trail.
