Noting that the ceremony’s esteemed guest of honor sure seemed like a cocky motherfucker, attendees of Augustana College’s graduation Sunday reported that the hotshot commencement speaker just jumped straight into his speech without even defining the word “courage.” “Well, well, well—not even a single mention of the Merriam-Webster dictionary—this guy clearly plays by his own rules,” said graduate Alex Harris, watching in disbelief as the president of the Children’s Hospital of Illinois launched right into a no-holds-barred summary of his career without even once briefly pausing to ask the attendees to consider what the word “integrity” meant to them.
