Following dinner at the home of Stan and Linda Paulson and their three children, alarmed houseguest Brendan Murphy told reporters Wednesday that the local family’s preferred euphemism for human genitalia is apparently the word “dinky.” “The first couple times it came up, I had no idea what they were talking about, and then suddenly it hit me: They call them dinkies,” said Murphy, explaining that his confusion began during the family’s discussion of a baseball player who had been hit just below the waist by a line drive.
